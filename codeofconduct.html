        <h1>Code of Conduct</h2>
        <p>
          All attendees, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers at our events are
          required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organizers will
          enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all
          participants to help ensure a fun environment for everyone.
        </p>

        <h2 class="lead2">Need Help?</h2>
        <p>
          If you feel something has violated the Code of conduct, please chat with
          the PubConf host or any volunteer during the event. You can also
          reach us before or after the events at <a href="mailto:hello@pubconf.io">hello@pubconf.io</a>.

        <h2>The Quick Version</h2>
        <p>
          Don't be a jerk. Relax.
        </p>

        <h2>Expectations</h2>
        <p>
          PubConf is a technology comedy variety show. We create an intimate social
          environment for amazing and funny technology conversations. In a pub.
          Our attendees and speakers are encouraged to laugh, drink, meet new people
          and share outrageous ideas. Innuendo, cursing, and NSFW materials will
          make it into the show. If this is upsetting, PubConf may not be for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Negative or hateful language, comments, or slides will not be tolerated. This
          includes racially-charged, sexual-orientation, disability, age, or religion. Do
          not insult, stereotype, or make fun of others, even if you share the attribute.
        </p>

        <h2>Social Media</h2>
        <p>
          Many of our speakers are renowned in their fields. We want them to feel
          relaxed and unencumbered as their talks will hopefully deviate into territory
          they wouldn't normally speak about. <strong>We respectfully ask that no
          video, pictures, or quotes from our speakers or their talks be shared on
          social media</strong> without their express permission.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please, share that you are having a good time and PubConf. Make your friends
          jealous and want to come next year. But don't get anyone in trouble over
          what is said at the pub.
        </p>

        <h2>Violations</h2>
        <p>
          If you are uncomfortable with something happening at PubConf, please have
          a conversation with the individual first. Many conflicts are easily resolved
          with a simple word.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you need help, please contact the host or any PubConf volunteer.
          Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
          immediately. PubConf reserves the right to expel participants violating
          this code of conduct.
