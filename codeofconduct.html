    <h2>The Quick Version</h2>
    <p>
      Don't be a jerk. Relax.

    <h2>Expectations</h2>
    <p>
      PubConf is a technology comedy variety show. We create an intimate social
      environment for amazing and funny technology conversations. In a pub.
      Our attendees and speakers are encouraged to laugh, drink, meet new people
      and share outrageous ideas. Innuendo, cursing, and NSFW materials will
      make it into the show. If this is upsetting, PubConf may not be for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Negative or hateful language, comments, or slides will not be tolerated. This
      includes racially-charged, sexual-orientation, disability, age, or religion. Do
      not insult, stereotype, or make fun of others, even if you share the attribute.
    </p>
 
    <h2>Social Media</h2>
    <p>
      Many of our speakers are renouned in their fields. We want them to feel
      relaxed and unencumbered as their talks will hopefully deviate into territory
      they wouldn't normally speak about. <strong>We respectfully ask that no
      video, pictures, or quotes from our speakers or their talks be shared on
      social media</strong> without their express permission.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please, share that you are having a good time and PubConf. Make your friends
      jealous and want to come next year. But don't get anyone in trouble over
      what is said at the pub.
    </p>
