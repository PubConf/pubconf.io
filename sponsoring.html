      PubConf is a software conference afterparty and comedy show. We host
      the most captivating speakers to do fun, rapid-fire talks in the relaxed atmosphere
      of a local pub. It's all the best parts of a weeklong conference condensed
      into one beer-fueled evening. There's really nothing else like it.

      PubConf attendance is limited to 250 people, and sells out quickly. PubConf
      speakers and attendees are technology influencers for their companies
      and clients, and the industry overall.

        Draft sponsors are the backbone of PubConf, but occasionally you need
        something grander. Top-Shelf sponsors also get included by the PubConf writers
        for the opening and closing monologues. We'll include your brand or product
        into our jokes, and encourage our featured guests to do so as well.
      </p>

        The way we were included throughout the night was perfect.
        So much better than just having our logo on the opening slide.<br />
