Event Images
==============

Most PubConf events will need several images for the website to render fully. Check the `_template` directory for a good starting point. Images you will need:

- Event Logo, Vector
- Event Background, 600x300
- Share Image, 2000x1000
- Partner Logo, 400x240

All images should be compressed for fast web delivery.
